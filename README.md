# Amber's Dots

![Image](https://cloud-lgc673ndr-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)

These are my Fedora dotfiles for Hyprland! I run this on an M2 Macbook Air via Asahi.

### Software
- Hyprland (compositor)
- Waybar (bar at the top)
- Rofi (app launcher)
- Dunst (notifications)
- Zed (code editor)
- SystemD (script launcher)

This setup includes my custom keybinds for Hyprland, my theme, custom waybar and rofi configs. A dunst config which for some reason doesn't work, my Zed config (not finished) and scripts to automatically switch light/dark theme at sunrise/sunset.
